# Artifission

## Introduction

Artifission is a single player action platformer concept built around the idea of the player constructing their own magical attacks and utilities using a system of interacting runes. The project features a fully implemented spell creation system, as well as full combat mechanics. Content is ongoing, and currently art is complete for a small outdoor/indoor castle environment being used for testing purposes. 

The project is being built in Unity, using C#, and has received updates when my free time allows since 2020. 

## Installation

To run the project, clone the repo and open the main scene in Unity. Development uses Unity 2018, I cannot gaurantee that it will work on newer or older versions.

## Current Content

- "Spellforges" allow the players to develop their own spells by combining form and effect runes to create unique prodcedural effects.
- Enemy AI operates on fully implemented custom state machines, and combat involves slinging around damage, forces, and status effects.
- A small test environment using some of the game's completed art allow the player to explore movement and spellcasting in both open outdoor settings and indoor environemnts.
- Cutscene controls and other ancillary systems exist to enable the future creation of interesting gameplay worlds.

## Planned Content

- Finished art for a full demo level.
- New animated enemies for the demo.
- Additional sounds and music.
- Animations for the main characters
